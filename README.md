# Console_Dice_Game

**Recommend to open this project in Eclipse IDE.** 

## Project gradually build level by level adding up new functionality
**1. Level 1**
   - a game that simulates a player rolling dice. There are 2 dice in the game and on each of they can drop from 1 to 6 points. The user guesses a number from 2 to 12, then rolls cubes. After the roll, shows the dice drawn with symbols and the number of points rolled. The user wins if the result is a score greater than zero. At the end displays the formula for calculating points, the final number of points minus double errors in guessing and makes a verdict - the user won or lost.

**2. Level 2**
   - Includes the second player into the game - the computer. The user throws first. Then a computer. Then comes scoring and the winner is announced with an indication of the difference in points. The one who has more points wins, even if he has a negative result. A tie is also possible if the points of players are equal.

**4. Level 3**
   - Program holds not one round, but three is held. Thus, user and computer must roll the dice alternately three times each. At the end of each round, data on the difference in the score of the players is displayed. After the last round, a table with the results of the entire game comes out.

   - In case the user agrees, the game starts again. In case of failure, the program ends its work.
